Nguyên liệu:
Oil: 2 tablespoons
Red Onions: 2 medium
Kale: 1 lb
Salt: Dash
Double Cream: 1 cup 

Công thức:
Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add the shredded kale to the onions and mix well. Turn the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 5 minutes.
After 5 minutes, remove the lid, add salt to taste, and stir in the cream. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. The cream will thicken slightly, making for a deliciously rich creamed kale and onions. Yumm!
Serve it up with your favorite Kenyan stew, and a side of ugali!
