Tên món ăn: Stovetop Eggplant With Harissa, Chickpeas, and Cumin Yogurt
Category: Vegetarian
Nguồn Gốc: American

Nguyên liệu:
Olive Oil: 4 tablespoons
Egg Plants: 6 small
Harissa Spice: ½ tablespoon
Chickpeas: 1 can
Cherry Tomatoes: 2 cups halved
Greek yogurt: 1 1/2 cups
Ground cumin: 1 tablespoon
Parsley: ½ cup 

Công thức:
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the eggplants and lower the heat to medium. Season with salt and pepper as you rotate the eggplants, browning them on all sides. Continue to cook, turning regularly, until a fork inserted into the eggplant meets no resistance (you may have to stand them up on their fat end to finish cooking the thickest parts), about 20 minutes, lowering the heat and sprinkling water into the pan as necessary if the eggplants threaten to burn or smoke excessively.

2.
Mix the harissa, chickpeas and tomatoes together, then add to the eggplants. Cook until the tomatoes have blistered and broken down, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper and add water as necessary to thin to a saucy consistency. Meanwhile, combine the yogurt and cumin in a serving bowl. Season with salt and pepper.

3.
Top the eggplant mixture with the parsley, drizzle with more extra virgin olive oil, and serve with the yogurt on the side.
